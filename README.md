# House-prices-prediction-ML
The projects' goal was to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts house prices. This is a house price prediction data set so we will be using regression models because it is a continuous target variable data set. By understanding the attributes we removed some unnecessary ones and kept only the useful ones, we did some visualisations to see how the prices are affected and to ensure that there are no outliers. At last, a confusion matrix showed that we have a solid 95% accuracy.

1. Data collection and understanding data (our target variable is the sales price)
2. preparing data (Outliers,Target variable,Features engineering,missing data,data correlation,imputing missing values,skewed features,dummy categorical features)
   -Feature engineering ( 1- Imputation 2- Discretization 3-Categorical Encoding 4-Feature Splitting 5-Handling Outliers 6-Variable Transformations  7-Scaling 8-Creating Features)
3. choosing the right model for the data set
4. train the model
5. evaluate the model
6. tune the model(kfolds cross validation)
7. test and make prediction
